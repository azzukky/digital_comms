# Personal Workspace

You should not modify the files or directories that you download from the Github repository. Otherwise,
you may encounter version conflicts that prevent you from updating the contents of the repository. If that ever happens, the commmand
```
git restore .
```
may be your friend.

Any content you place in this directory will be outside the repository and should not conflict with updates to the repository. Therefore, you should put all your notebooks and other material in this directory.
